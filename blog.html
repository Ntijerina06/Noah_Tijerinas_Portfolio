            <h2 class="post_title">Life Is Good</h2>
            
            <p class="post_paragraph">Hey, it has been a while since I made a post. Happy holidays to everyone. I went to Mexico and Universal Studios for Thanksgiving. Recently, 
                I visited the Stanford labs. It was an amazing experience, and I saw many cool things and learned a lot. 
                So, the good news is that I am now helping my SSG mento with some research he has wanted to do but has yet to have the time for. 
                I am really interested in the topic, and it excites me to know that if we find something, it can inspire other researchers to explore more into what we see.
                I am learning how to use pandas on a deeper level, and I will start to understand the nuances of data science. These past weeks have been amazing, 
                and I want to give my thanks to God because as my faith has gotten stronger, my life has been getting exponentially better. I was chosen out of 17 students 
                from De Anza to go to a leadership retreat. I got an email that I'm in the second stage of a Stanford data science mentorship. My startup is progressing. 
                We have three individuals interested in being the CTO, and we are having a meeting to introduce our four new interns. I am nervous because once we get a team, 
                there will be much more pressure on me as a co-founder, but I am hopeful to see what's to come. I also just submitted my Berkely Transfer-To-Excellence application.
                I spent a long time on my application, and I am very proud of it. Hopefully, I will get in. Fingers crossed. Have a good rest of your night, too, whoever is reading this.
                See you eventually :)). </p>

            <h2 class="post_title">Rushing The Process</h2>
            
            <p class="post_paragraph">Hey, I just wanted to get on here and talk about what's happening in my life. Currently, I have some bad news. 
                I was really excited to apply to a few summer research opportunities at Stanford. I went to 3 or 4 informational Zoom sessions just to 
                find out I'm not eligible because I haven't taken enough stem classes or i'm not in my transfer year. This sucks, but now I can focus on 
                the Berkely Transfer-to-Excellence application. So, the better news is I just finished my Stanford SSG program. I had an amazing time, and 
                if any other community college student gets the opportunity to apply, they should do so. I also wanted to share something that my father told 
                me a few days ago; he said: "Don't rush your life." Some people might overlook this, but it stopped me in my tracks. It made me realize, I am 
                rushing my life. I always think about the future to the point where I live in it. I constantly think of going to a 4 year, getting a job, and 
                having a family to the point where I'm not living in the present. It was just something interesting I wanted to share, but thank you for reading. 
                See you initially :() </p>

            <h2 class="post_title">Find Happiness Within</h2>
            
            <p class="post_paragraph">Before I start my homework, I wanted to share my new perspective on life. I recently came upon a video 
                of a UFC fighter. I don't know the exact fighter, but he said something that resonated with me. 
                He said something along the lines of " The greatest moment in my life is when I realized I didn't need a belt to be happy." 
                He had just won the UFC World Champion belt, something he had worked his whole life for. It made me really reflect on my source of 
                happiness. Currently, one of the only sources of joy I find is one day getting accepted into a prestigious University, but that 
                shouldn't be the case. I shouldn't let a school dictate my happiness; I should find happiness within and through god. This hasn't 
                shifted my determination to accomplish my goals because I will still give it my all to get accepted into my dream university. 
                Still, besides that, I went to a hackathon. I spent 15-plus hours coding an AI assistant called Nova to help kids learn about space, 
                but sadly, I didn't place. I still learned a lot, but hopefully, I will win the next hackathon I attend. Thank you for reading. 
                See you Eventually :)</p>

            <h2 class="post_title">Why The Laugh?</h2>
            
            <p class="post_paragraph"> Sorry for the delay in posting. My life has been pretty stagnant recently. Nothing too crazy. Some
                news is that I got my first software engineering internship, and I will be a Python Dev at Duarte. I am
                super excited to contribute to their new product coming out. I also have been applying to a lot of
                Stanford summer research programs. The one I really want to get into is SURF, but when looking at the
                pictures, it looks like none of the accepted applicants come from a community college, but I am hopeful.
                A realization that I have made is people think I am crazy. Whenever I tell someone about my future
                aspirations, they just laugh at me. I tell them I want to get into a top 15 university, have a
                successful start-up, or go into quant. They chuckle. As a community college student, I feel people look
                down on me and think I am not competent enough because I didn't get into a good college out of high
                school. I hope it is a good thing that they are laughing because one day, I know I will accomplish great
                things. If anyone is reading this, please email me at noahtijerina06@gmail.com and tell me how you like
                my blog. See you eventually ;).</p>

            <h2 class="post_title">Had A Taste</h2>
            <p class="post_paragraph">
                This week was my first week as a college student; I enjoyed school, I love my classes, and De Anza College feels like a space where I can continue my studies. The only downside is how little spare time I have on some days. Since I work, it can be stressful and tiring. This Wednesday and Tuesday, I had a little taste of the grind; Tuesday, I was at school all day, then I rushed to cross country practice, ran 7 miles, then I had to join my Stanford SSG meeting, then do homework for a few hours, lastly sleep. On Wednesday, I had school at 10:30 am, which was nice because I got to go on a walk with my mom. Still, I woke up early to do homework. I went to class, went to cross country, went home, ate food, and went to work; then, at around 9 pm, I came home, did homework, and worked on a club constitution. I'm nervous about what will happen when I have clubs, but I am hopeful for what will come. Also, I had a PR at 26:16 minutes for 4 miles at my cross-country meet on Friday. Thanks, see you eventually :).            </p>

            <h2 class="post_title">Had the Itch</h2>
            <p class="post_paragraph">
                I was waiting for the end of this week to make a post on my blog, but I have been very excited to write. I want to reveal more about my personality. I am currently 18 years old, and I am going to De Anza Community College. 
                I love to skateboard. I have been doing it my whole life but got into it during COVID. I have a sponsor, and I participate in local competitions. I also get these itchs to play chess, and I am currently creating lots of coding projects, which led to this blog. 
                In high school, I didn't know how the college system worked. I thought that if I had a decent GPA and some volunteering experience, I would have a 10% chance of getting into UC Berkeley. I took four APs, two dual enrollment, 120+ hours of volunteering, and two clubs, and I had a 3.5 GPA. As a computer science major, I applied to 12 schools, including the University of Oregon - Harvey Mudd and UCLA. 
                I got into the University of Oregon and UCSC off the waitlist. That is why I go to Community College. See you eventually. :)

                Hi, my name is Noah Tijerina. I like to skateboard, run, play chess, and code!! This is my first blog post, it took my around 5 hours to code this website.
                I plan to document my journey to get into a 4-year college and break into tech. I go to a community college. I will try to post every week. Thank you :)
