                I was waiting for the end of this week to make a post on my blog, but I have been very excited to write. I want to reveal more about my personality. I am currently 18 years old, and I am going to De Anza Community College. 
                I love to skateboard. I have been doing it my whole life but got into it during COVID. I have a sponsor, and I participate in local competitions. I also get these itchs to play chess, and I am currently creating lots of coding projects, which led to this blog. 
                In high school, I didn't know how the college system worked. I thought that if I had a decent GPA and some volunteering experience, I would have a 10% chance of getting into UC Berkeley. I took four APs, two dual enrollment, 120+ hours of volunteering, and two clubs, and I had a 3.5 GPA. As a computer science major, I applied to 12 schools, including the University of Oregon - Harvey Mudd and UCLA. 
                I got into the University of Oregon and UCSC off the waitlist. That is why I go to Community College. See you eventually. :)

                Hi, my name is Noah Tijerina. I like to skateboard, run, play chess, and code!! This is my first blog post, it took my around 5 hours to code this website.
                I plan to document my journey to get into a 4-year college and break into tech. I go to a community college. I will try to post every week. Thank you :)
