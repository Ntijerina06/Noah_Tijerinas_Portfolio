            <h2 class="post_title">Why The Laugh?</h2>
            
            <p class="post_paragraph"> Sorry for the delay in posting. My life has been pretty stagnant recently. Nothing too crazy. Some
                news is that I got my first software engineering internship, and I will be a Python Dev at Duarte. I am
                super excited to contribute to their new product coming out. I also have been applying to a lot of
                Stanford summer research programs. The one I really want to get into is SURF, but when looking at the
                pictures, it looks like none of the accepted applicants come from a community college, but I am hopeful.
                A realization that I have made is people think I am crazy. Whenever I tell someone about my future
                aspirations, they just laugh at me. I tell them I want to get into a top 15 university, have a
                successful start-up, or go into quant. They chuckle. As a community college student, I feel people look
                down on me and think I am not competent enough because I didn't get into a good college out of high
                school. I hope it is a good thing that they are laughing because one day, I know I will accomplish great
                things. If anyone is reading this, please email me at noahtijerina06@gmail.com and tell me how you like
                my blog. See you eventually ;).</p>

            <h2 class="post_title">Had A Taste</h2>
            <p class="post_paragraph">
                This week was my first week as a college student; I enjoyed school, I love my classes, and De Anza College feels like a space where I can continue my studies. The only downside is how little spare time I have on some days. Since I work, it can be stressful and tiring. This Wednesday and Tuesday, I had a little taste of the grind; Tuesday, I was at school all day, then I rushed to cross country practice, ran 7 miles, then I had to join my Stanford SSG meeting, then do homework for a few hours, lastly sleep. On Wednesday, I had school at 10:30 am, which was nice because I got to go on a walk with my mom. Still, I woke up early to do homework. I went to class, went to cross country, went home, ate food, and went to work; then, at around 9 pm, I came home, did homework, and worked on a club constitution. I'm nervous about what will happen when I have clubs, but I am hopeful for what will come. Also, I had a PR at 26:16 minutes for 4 miles at my cross-country meet on Friday. Thanks, see you eventually :).            </p>

            <p class="post_paragraph">
                I was waiting for the end of this week to make a post on my blog, but I have been very excited to write. I want to reveal more about my personality. I am currently 18 years old, and I am going to De Anza Community College. 
                I love to skateboard. I have been doing it my whole life but got into it during COVID. I have a sponsor, and I participate in local competitions. I also get these itchs to play chess, and I am currently creating lots of coding projects, which led to this blog. 
                In high school, I didn't know how the college system worked. I thought that if I had a decent GPA and some volunteering experience, I would have a 10% chance of getting into UC Berkeley. I took four APs, two dual enrollment, 120+ hours of volunteering, and two clubs, and I had a 3.5 GPA. As a computer science major, I applied to 12 schools, including the University of Oregon - Harvey Mudd and UCLA. 
                I got into the University of Oregon and UCSC off the waitlist. That is why I go to Community College. See you eventually. :)

                Hi, my name is Noah Tijerina. I like to skateboard, run, play chess, and code!! This is my first blog post, it took my around 5 hours to code this website.
                I plan to document my journey to get into a 4-year college and break into tech. I go to a community college. I will try to post every week. Thank you :)
